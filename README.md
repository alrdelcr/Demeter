# Demeter

## Project Objectives
DeMeter, named after the Greek goddess of agriculture and fertility (also doubling as ”The Meter”),
is an intelligent hydroponic system designed to be self-nourishing, nutrient-tracking, and user-observable
through a web-app portal where users can monitor plant growth. It is designed for ease of use, targeting
customers who may not have a green thumb. The system includes a water pumping mechanism, nutrient
sensors, and a live feed to the web portal.

The primary objective is to develop an automated hydroponic system that not only regulates pH
and nutrient levels but also provides real-time monitoring and user control via a web-based interface.
The system integrates pH, EC, and temperature sensors through the Raspberry Pi to dispense pH-up,
pH-down, and nutrient solutions as needed. Sensor data is continuously logged and visualized through
interactive graphs, allowing users to track environmental changes. Unlike static automation, our system
enables users to set and adjust ideal values for pH and EC thresholds directly through the web interface,
ensuring adaptability for different plant types and growing conditions.
